TAIOB Setup
=========================

This guide will tell you how to set up this bot and get it online
# Getting Started

**Step One**  
You will have to navigate to 'config.example.json' and add the required values where indicated and change the name to 'config.json'.

**Step Two**

Go into your console and type the command 'node server.js' and you should get a prompt in the logs that tells you that you have been logged in.

**Step Three**

Your done as far as setting up the bot. You are free to go into files and edit the code their to make the bot how you want it. However if you choose to do that then dont expect me to fix it if you break the bot.

**Support**
If you ever need help setting up the bot then please join the discord support server:

Now enjoy this bot. Remeber that it is still under developement so I would highly recommend that you join the server above to get notifications about when there are updates for the code.
